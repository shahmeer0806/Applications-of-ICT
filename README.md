  Assembly Reflections 

○ What did you notice about registers and instructions?
Assembly registers are memory locations inside CPU that hold data and instructions for quick access. On the other hand, instructions in assembly are those commands that tell the CPU to perform those instructions.

○ How is coding in Assembly different from Python? 
Coding in Assembly is quite different and tougher than that in Python. The main reason for this distinction is the level of these languages. Python being a high-level language is easier to comprehend for coders. Assembly language being closer to the hardware is significantly faster but not intuitive to understand.


  Python Reflections 
  
○ Why is Python easier/faster for building the same project? 
Python is easier because it is a high-level language. It takes lesser time to code the same project in python due to its simplicity. However, code execution will be faster on Assembly written code.

○ Which features of Python help abstraction (variables, functions, loops)? 

   Comparison Table 
| Feature           | Assembly Example | Python Example 
|-------------------|------------------|----------------
| Variable storage  | Register (EAX)   | x = 5` |
| Printing output   | INT 21h          | print() |
| Arithmetic        | ADD AX, BX       | x + y |
